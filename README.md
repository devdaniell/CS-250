• **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?**

Interpreting user needs typically begins with system analysis. This can be accomplished by soliciting feedback from the team, asking previous users about errors or desired changes in the code. It's also crucial to identify inputs and outputs.

User stories are valuable tools in gathering this information as they allow users to express their needs and wants directly. By examining user stories, developers can gain insight into the end user's perspective, helping to align the program with actual user requirements.

• **How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

Programs can be developed using various approaches. The Waterfall Method is one strategy that helps in projecting specific needs of a project in a linear fashion. Another method is Agile, which offers a more flexible strategy. Agile incorporates iterative development, continuous testing, planning, and client integration throughout the development process. This approach allows for adaptability and responsiveness to changing requirements.

• **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Being a good team member in software development involves several key aspects. Firstly, it's crucial to understand your part of the project and ensure you're keeping up with your responsibilities without causing delays that could impact the rest of the team. Equally important is the ability to listen to your co-workers and offer help when needed. Good team members are collaborative, communicative, and willing to support others to achieve the project's overall goals. They contribute not only through their individual work but also by fostering a positive and productive team environment.
